The development of the combined modeling system is to assist North Carolina (NC) Division of Water Quality (DWQ) of Department of Environment and Natural Resource (DENR) to determine if there is assimilative capacity for additional nutrient loading to the reservoir. Currently available data indicate that there may be violations of the chlorophyll-a and turbidity standards in Falls Lake. DWQ believes that Falls Lake will be considered impaired in the next basinwide planning cycle. Data collected during and prior to the modeling field study indicate sufficient violations for turbidity such that placement on the federal 303(d) list of impaired waters is probable. The model created in the proposed project will also be utilized for future TMDL development.<br>
                                Year 2: Additional modeling work is required to validate the combined model system during 2007. In addition, a number of scenario model runs are needed to help develop nutrient management strategies for Falls Lake. Since TMDL is potentially required for Falls Lake, technical training workshops are also needed for DWQ staff to continuously use the model being developed by this project.	</p>
