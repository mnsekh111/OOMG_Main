                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Objective 4.1: Enhance and operate a Coupled Marine Environmental Assessment and Prediction System.
SECOORA will work with members at NCSU to: 1) sustain NCSU's South Atlantic Bight Gulf of Mexico
(SABGOM) ocean circulation daily N/F modeling system; 2) establish the full couplings of wave
(SWAN), atmosphere (WRF) and ocean circulation (ROMS) models, and generate regional, high resolution
nowcasts and forecasts of ocean circulation, waves, marine weather, lower trophic level marine ecosystem
predictions and other value added products; 3) implement into the prediction system a routine data
assimilation of satellite-observed sea surface temperature and sea surface height, glider-measured subsurface
temperature and salinity, HFR-measured surface currents and other environmental data collected in
regional fishery independent surveys; 4) continue model skill assessment for marine environmental variables
through appropriate comparisons with independent (non-assimilated) observations (e.g., mooring observations).
Working with SAFMC, the team will also start developing the interface between NCSU's
oceanographic modeling system and Ecopath as well as other higher trophic level ecological/fishery models.
Through this work, SECOORA will implement an advanced regional marine environmental assessment
and prediction capability over the entire SECOORA domain with associated error estimates, and update
and transmit information to stakeholders in a timely and clear fashion.</p>
