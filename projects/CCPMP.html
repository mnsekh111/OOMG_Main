                           <h3>Description</h3>
                             <p>The Ocean Observing and Modeling Group (OOMG) has been studying coastal circulation dynamics using both numerical models and in-situ observations. Realistic coastal circulation hindcast experiments have been performed for various coastal segments (Gulf of Maine, Middle-Atlantic Bight, South Atlantic Bight, Gulf of Mexico) along the U.S. east coast to develop an understanding of synoptic, seasonal, and inter-annual variability of regional circulation. The group has been utilizing the state-of-the-art Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), which is nested inside the state-of-the-art, data-assimilative, North Atlantic basin-scale model, HYCOM for realistic specifications of offshore boundary conditions. All regional ROMS applications developed by OOMG have also considered realistic local forcing including, surface wind, heat fluxes, and coastal runoff. This proposal provides background on OOMG's South Atlantic Bight-Gulf of Mexico (SABGOM) model, which we propose to support and provide open boundary conditions for various regional and sub-regional sediment transport models to be pursed in the "Carolina Coastal Change Processes" program.
