                <h3>Description</h3>
                                <p>Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission/Fish & Wildlife Research Institute (FWC/FWRI) is working on developing an application that will integrate near real-time sea conditions (numerical model output) with fisheries locations and ranges in order to inform scientists and fishermen regarding the safety and feasibility of taking a boat out in current conditions and to the planned fishing site. The targeted numerical model output to be integrated in developing this application is the South Atlantic Bight and Gulf of Mexico Circulation Nowcast/Forecast (SABGOM) modeling system by Ruoying He at NC State University (NCSU). The project manager will work with NCSU modelers and FWRI PI and technical assistant to ensure the availability of model data access via geospatial web services (Web Mapping Service via NCSU THREDDS server and NetCDF) to facilitate the development of the application. Once the prototype is developed with SABGOM, the technology could be leveraged to integrate other sub-regional forecast models. Objectives: 1. Provide technical assistance to link the model output with the application developers who are producing the tool for use by the fisheries managers. 2. Enhance SABGOB model output interface to support fishery management and service. 3. Meet with FWRI and SECOORA scientists for project review and discussions.	</p>
